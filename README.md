# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Tkinter library. 

The game allows the player to control a snake using the arrow keys and navigate it on a grid. 
The objective is to eat the red food dots that appear randomly on the grid and grow the snake's length. 
However, the game ends if the snake collides with itself.

## Features
- Smooth snake movement and controls
- Random generation of food dots
- Collision detection and game over condition
- Score tracking

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## How to Play
1. Run the `snake.py` file using Python.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.
3. Try to eat the red food dots to increase your score and grow the snake.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.
5. Press the 'P' key to pause/resume the game.
6. Press the 'Enter' key to restart the game.

Enjoy playing the Snake Game!
